# Aeroloop Gazebo

This project is a collection of Gazebo resources to be used for
hardware/software in the loop testing of UAVs. 

As a baseline, resources have been taken from
[Gazebo Models](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_models/src). This repository
will serve as an independent collection of resources with the goal in mind of
developing realistic and accurate aircraft models.
